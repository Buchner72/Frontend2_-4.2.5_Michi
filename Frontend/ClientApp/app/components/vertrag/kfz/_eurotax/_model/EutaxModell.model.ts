﻿// Interfaces vs Classes
// https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html
// One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing”
// or “structural subtyping”. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts
// within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.

export interface Modell {
    name: string;
    natCode: string;
    importVonBis: string;
}
